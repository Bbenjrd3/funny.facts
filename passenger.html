        <h2>What is General Aviation?</h2>
        <p>
            General aviation (GA) is a broad and dynamic sector of the aviation industry that encompasses all non-commercial and non-military flight operations. From small private planes and helicopters to business jets, GA serves a variety of purposes, including recreational flying, business travel, and emergency services. Unlike commercial airlines, which focus on scheduled passenger and cargo flights, general aviation caters to a more personalized and flexible approach to air travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the defining features of general aviation is its diversity. It includes everything from flight training schools and agricultural aviation to aerial photography and medical evacuation. Private pilots flying their own aircraft for leisure form a significant portion of GA operations. Additionally, corporate aviation allows businesses to transport executives and employees efficiently, often to locations not served by commercial airlines.
        </p>
        <p>
            General aviation plays a vital role in connecting rural and remote areas to larger cities. Many small airports across the globe exist primarily to support GA activities. These airports act as hubs for emergency medical flights, law enforcement, and disaster response operations, making GA an indispensable part of national infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sector also serves as a stepping stone for aspiring pilots. Flight schools and training centers, a subset of GA, provide the foundational skills needed for professional careers in aviation. General aviationâ€™s contribution to the global economy is immense, generating billions of dollars in revenue and providing millions of jobs worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            As technology advances, the future of general aviation looks promising. Innovations such as electric aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) are expected to revolutionize the sector, making it more efficient, accessible, and environmentally friendly. General aviation is not just about flying; it represents freedom, innovation, and a vital connection between communities.
